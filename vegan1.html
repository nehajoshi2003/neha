 <h1>   WHY TO GO VEGAN ??   </h1>
 <h2>1. It’s the Best Way to Help Animals: </h2>   
 <p>Every vegan saves nearly 200 animals per year.There is simply no easier way to help animals and prevent suffering than by choosing plant-based foods over meat, eggs, and dairy “products.”</p>

 <h2>2. Slim Down and Become Energized: </h2>
<p> Vegans are, on average, up to 20 pounds lighter than meat-eaters are. And unlike unhealthy fad diets, which leave you feeling tired (and usually don’t keep the pounds off for long), going vegan allows you to keep the excess fat off for good and have plenty of energy.</p>

<h2>3. Be Healthier and Happier: </h2>
<p>According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, vegans are less likely to develop heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and high blood pressure than meat-eaters are. Vegans get all the nutrients that they need to be healthy, such as plant protein, fiber, and minerals, without all the nasty stuff in meat that may slow you down and make you sick, such as cholesterol and saturated animal fat.</p>

<h2>4. Vegan Food Is Delicious: </h2>
<p>When you go vegan, you can still eat all your favorite foods, including burgers, “chicken” sandwiches, and ice cream. The only difference? You’ll be ditching the cruelty and cholesterol that go hand in hand with using animals for food. As the demand for vegan food skyrockets, companies are coming out with more and more delicious meat– and dairy-free options that taste great, are much healthier than their animal-derived counterparts, and don’t hurt any living beings. Plus, we have a list of some of our favorite products and thousands of tasty kitchen-tested recipes to help you get started!</p>

<h2>5. Help Feed the World: </h2>
<p>Eating meat doesn’t just hurt animals—it hurts people, too. It takes tons of crops and water to raise farmed animals. In fact, it takes up to 13 pounds of grain to produce just 1 pound of animal flesh! All that plant food could be used much more efficiently if people just ate it directly. The more people who go vegan, the better able we’ll be to feed the hungry.</p>

</br>
<h2>6. Save the Planet: </h2>
<p>Meat is not environmentally friendly. Consuming it is actually one of the worst things that you can do for the Earth. Meat production is wasteful and causes enormous amounts of pollution, and the industry is also one of the biggest causes of the climate crisis. Going vegan is more effective than switching to a “greener” car in the fight against the climate crisis.</p>

<h2>7. All the Cool Kids Are Doing It: </h2>
<p>The list of stars who shun animal flesh is basically a “who’s who” of today’s hottest celebrities. Joaquin Phoenix, Natalie Portman, Lizzo, and Alicia Silverstone are just some of the famous vegans who regularly appear in People magazine.</p>
</br>
<h2>8.Pigs are smatter than you think: </h2>
<p>Although most people are less familiar with pigs, chickens, fish, and cows than they are with dogs and cats, animals used for food are every bit as intelligent and able to suffer as the animals who share our homes are. Pigs can even learn to play video games.</p>
